Create a Git Flow structured project for a Model Optimizer skill with the following:

1. Directory structure:
   - src/ with subdirectories: pricing/, discovery/, optimizer/, config/, reporting/
   - tests/ directory
   - scripts/ directory with run-weekly.js
   - data/ directory for cache files
   - test/fixtures/ with sample SOUL.md

2. Core files:
   - SKILL.md (skill definition)
   - README.md (already exists, update it)
   - package.json with basic dependencies
   - .gitignore for Node.js projects
   - .gitflow file or documentation

3. Git Flow branches:
   - main (production)
   - develop (integration)
   - Feature branches will be created as feature/*
   - Release branches as release/*
   - Hotfix branches as hotfix/*

4. Initial commit should be on develop branch with this structure.

Important: This is just the skeleton - no implementation yet. Use ES6 modules.
